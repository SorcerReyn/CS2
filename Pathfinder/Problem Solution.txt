Problem Solution:

Using the already existing backtracking program, go through the maze every
possible run, and record all of the successful solutions in a stack, and when a
successful total path is found, convert the row into a string and place it in
the HashSet

Now I need to be able to go through all of the possible paths; including open
ones. I think it should be possible if I just utilize the for loop I already have
with all of the possible moves. I just need to tell my program to backtrack to
the next iteration and try again.
